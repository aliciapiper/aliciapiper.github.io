        <p class="aboutme"> Hello! My name is Alicia Piper and I am currently a junior in high school. I have worked as
        a site administrater and have also aided varying companies in setting up their social media marketing.
        I also compete in a speech and debate league in which I have placed in both speech and debate at regional and
        national level tournaments. My preferred sytle of debate is called Team Policy which changes a current US governmental
        policy for the better of the American people and is based upon factual evidence (similar to a congressional debate).
        In my spare time, I enjoy doing various forms of needle work and playing sports. My favorite sport to play is volleyball.
        My team both this year and last has made it into the championship consistently. I have 2 sisters and 5 brothers.
        I recently returned from Colombia with my parents from picking up my newly adopted little brother.</p>
